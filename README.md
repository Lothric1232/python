# Text-Based Adventure Game(Python)

This is a simple terminal-based Python game where you, the player, take on the role of a brave adventurer. You choose a class, face off against a boss, and engage in a turn-based battle using unique attacks. The game features randomized enemy behavior and allows you to play multiple times in one session.

How to Play:

Run the script using Python 3.

Enter your name when prompted.

Choose your class — Mage or Knight.

Pick a direction — left or right — to determine which boss you face.

Use your attacks strategically to bring the enemy's HP to zero before yours runs out.

After a win or loss, you'll be asked if you'd like to play again.
